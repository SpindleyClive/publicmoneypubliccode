    %h3 The Tech Vision
    %p In October 2018, Matt Hancock launched a Tech Vision “to build the most advanced health and care system in the world” where “outdated and obstructive NHS IT systems will become a thing of the past.”
    The vision describes that the “state of online services, basic IT and clinical tools in health and care is far behind where it needs to be”, and that, “We need to take a radical new approach
    to technology across the system and stop the narrative that it’s too difficult to do it right in health and care”.
    %p Ambitiously the Tech Vision outlined that, “The UK has the chance to lead the world on healthtech. We have the opportunity to build
    an ecosystem that continually creates the best healthtech – technology that can be exported, alongside new methods and insights that can contribute to health outcomes globally”.
    %p We love this vision. The NHS community loves this vision. Technologists love this vision.
    %p Even visions that get universal buy-in have a gap between intent and execution. Often that gap means the difference between a vision achieved and a vision unrealised.

    %h3 What Works and What Doesn’t
    %p We don’t want to dwell on the past, but we do want to learn from past mistakes and follow a roadmap dedicated to executing this vision and making it a success; a legacy for all involved. The future of this vision will be defined by the execution path taken:

          %td Design for Emergence
    %p Based on tangible evidence, there can only be one path to success. Professor Margunn Aanestad from the University of Oslo studied this very concept and established that design for emergence and cultivation was the most effective route to achieving real and long lasting change with concrete benefits.
    %p Professor Aanestad focused on implementation strategies, specifically for large interoperable networks. She found that large, centrally managed projects with up front design failed. However, iterative development and gradual expansion reduced overall complexity and led to on demand growth. Results were immediate, and the development which was cultivated became the national standard.
